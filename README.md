# soss-fiware

System handle to connect [*SOSS*][soss] to [*FIWARE*][fiware]

## Installation

0. Prerequisites: curlpp and asio installed
1. [Create a colcon workspace](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Colcon-Tutorial/#create-a-workspace).
2. Clone the soss project into the source subfolder.
3. Clone this project into the subfolder.
4. Clone the soss-ros2 plugin (or any other plugin needed) into the subfolder. <!-- ToDo: Add link to soss-ros2 -->:

    The workspace layout should look like this:
    ```
        soss_wp
        └── src
            ├── soss
            |   └── ... (soss project subfolders)
            ├── soss-ros2 (repo)
            └── soss-fiware (repo)
                    ├── fiware (soss-fiware colcon pkg)
                    └── fiware-test (soss-fiware-test colcon pkg)
    ```

5. In the workspace folder, execute colcon: `colcon build --packages-up-to soss-fiware`.
6. Source the current environment: `source install/local_setup.bash`.

## Usage

This system handle can be used to connect FIWARE with other systems.

### Configuration

SOSS must be configured with a YAML file, which tells the program everything it needs to know in order to establish the connection between two or more systems that the user wants. 
For example, if a simple string message wants to be exchanged between FIWARE and ROS2, the configuration file for SOSS should look as follows.

```YAML
systems:
    ros2: { type: ros2 }
    fiware: { type: fiware, host: "192.168.1.59", port: 1026}

routes:
    fiware_to_ros2: { from: fiware, to: ros2 }
    ros2_to_fiware: { from: ros2, to: fiware }

topics:
    hello_fiware: { type: "std_msgs/String", route: ros2_to_fiware }
    hello_ros2: { type: "std_msgs/String", route: fiware_to_ros2 }
```

To see how general SOSS systems, users and topics are configured, please refer to [SOSS' documentation](https://github.com/osrf/soss).

For the FIWARE system handle, the user must give two extra YAML key-value pairs which are the host and port in which this system handle will try to connect to an instance of FIWARE's Orion context broker.

FIWARE does not allow certain characters in its entities names. For this reason, if a type defined in the topics section of the configuration file has in its name a `/`, the FIWARE system handle will map that character into two underscores. This is something important to notice when connecting to ROS2, because in ROS2 most of the types have a `/` in their names. Also, notice that in FIWARE the type will be published as an entity with the same name but with every slash substituted with two underscores. 

With that, in the YAML file the type under the `topics` section can have a `/` (and to connect to ROS2, normally it will HAVE to), just remember that in FIWARE the entity created must have the same name but with two underscores instead of a slash.

Notice that this system handle maps soss messages dyrectly to a JSON compatible with FIWARE. As FIWARE doesn't allow nested types, neither does this system handle.

### Run soss (with ros2)

0. Source the ros2 environment and compile with `--packages-up-to soss-ros2-test`
1. Source the current workspace (source instal/local_setup.bash)
1. Run soss (with the sample configuration): `soss src/soss-fiware/fiware/sample/hello_fiware_ros2.yaml`

- For more information, you can see the [demo steps](fiware/sample/demo.md),
and the related [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w90DAPkovjwj7673d5RfOINlAAc7kWb1)
- Also, you can have a look to the [internal design](fiware/doc/design.md)
- For a fast configuration, you can use the [dockerfile](Dockerfile)

### Changelog
